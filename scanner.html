	<h3 id="question">Did I see somewhere that you attended a bootcamp?</h3>
	<div id="answer"; style="color: grey"><p>I graduated from <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/" target="_blank">Dev Bootcamp</a> June 2015 with honors......just kidding, there's no honors. I don't emphasize it in my experiences because it tends be looked at as the extenet of my software education. I learned a huge amount in the program, much more than I could have by myself. It was a springboard to get me where I am now by teaching me relevant technologies and best practices in a real word collaborative working environment. But, the onsite portion of the program was 19 weeks which is only a fraction of the time I have spent learning and creating software. </p></div>
