      <h4>My journey to becoming a developer</h4>
    </b>
    <p>
      It took me a while but I made it! I've finally arrived at my true calling in life. 
      <br>
      I had a girlfriend that once said she new exactly what she wanted to do when she was 15 years old. She's been pretty successful in her field for some time now and plans to retire before she's 50. Of course I wanted to do lots of things when I was young too, just like every other kid. But realistically, did I really truly want to be an astronaut, or did I enjoy singing enough to become a rock star. 
      <br>
      You'll notice my path to becoming a web developer doesn't include computers until later on. But the curiosity and drive to learn and build new things has always been there. I'm sure if I had the recources I would have learned to code earlier. But I wouldn't go back and change that now. I've had too many different kinds of experiences and opportunities that have made me the well rounded person I've become.
    </p>
    <p>
      I spent the first 5 or so years of my life on an island. We had no heating, air, or even running water. So unlike my 3 year old nephew who can navigate an iPad, I spent the majority of my time outside. It wasn't till 3rd grade that I had my first experience with a computer. It was in the corner of our class and if we finished our work early we could play "Oregon Trail". Man I loved that game! But I loved finding out how things worked and making new things even more. In elementary school, I would spend my allowance on old electronics at yard sales just to take them apart to see how they worked. 
    </p>
    <p>
      I finally took an electronics class when I was about 11. We made circuit boards and all kinds of little gadgets. At the end, we built electric motors from scrap pieces of metal and wire. I won the award for having the most efficient motor. Around the same time I took a small engines class with all adults. I learned how to completely rebuild a lawnmower engine. I used this knowledge to fix old mowers and get money by clearing brush around the neighborhood. Naturally, when I started to drive, I was able to work on my own vehicle. I loved solving problems myself. I didn't mind if it meant getting my hands dirty while doing it. The greatest feeling was turning the key and having everything work...and realizing I saved a lot of money too!
    </p>
    <p>
      Around the end of high school and the begining of college I had to start using computers to complete school assignments. It wasn't until my junior year of college that I finally bought my first computer. At this point in my life, I had already decided to follow a career in management. I mostly used my computer to store pictures, music, and edit videos of friends. It wasn't long before my computer would need repair. I destroyed the screen after driving away with it on top of my roof. I had fixed so many other small electronics and appliances that I didn't have to think twice about just buying a new screen and doing it myself. Eventually I would take it apart again to replace the fan, then the hard drive, and so on.
    </p>
    <p>
      But anyone who's used a computer can tell you that you're much more likely to run into software related problems. By my senior year in college, friends were already calling me up to do the easiest things, like replacing doorknobs and doing oil changes. Suddenly people were now asking for help with their computers. I didn't really have any experience but I never turned down a challenge. I enjoy being the "go-to guy". Hitting restart after working on a computer and having everything work gave me that same feeling as turning the key to my car.I realized this was something I really enjoyed but also that I knew very little. While my ability to easily navigate a program or operating system was impressive to some, I knew the real fun was being able to create them.
    </p>
    <p>
      I graduated college and pursued my career in management until the economy began to decline. I turned that into an opportunity to live and work overseas. 
    </p>
    <p>
      My desire to find out more about the software side of computers began to grow. I looked into creating an iPhone app but it required owning a Mac. So I put that on hold since I didn't have the money. Later, I looked into moving back home to go to school and get a CS degree at Cal Poly. I was denied because I already have a bachelors degree. I would have to spend at least a year doing prerequiste courses to even think about entering a masters program. I decided going back to school was still what I would need to do. But before I could even come up with a plan, I discovered Dev Bootcamp (DBC). Without doing any research I applied, I already knew this is what I wanted to do. At that point I had never even really seen a line of code. And even though I had recently bought a new PC, I went and got myself a Mac. I had commited to going in 100% and not looking back.
    </p>
    <p>
      I graduated DBC in June 2015. It was a lot of work and probably the hardest thing I've done in my life. But I'm proud to have reached a level where I have enough knowledge to start working in my new career!
