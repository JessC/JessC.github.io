          <p>
            I graduated college and started working a corporate job. I envied friends that had the ability to travel abroad before they jumped into a career. So when the economy declined in 2008 and my company closed it's locations in California, I didn't hesitate to take a trip. After a month in Europe I started working for another big company. But I immediately felt that I wanted more international experience.
            </p>
            <p> So after working only 3 months, I packed up everything and moved to Asia. I spent the next several years working in Asia and Europe. I enjoyed a new sense of freedom that comes with working internationally. But at the same time, I felt more confined than ever before. Most of the time my work visa was usually tied to a specific company. And employers know they can pretty much do whatever they want...because the only other option is to quit and have to return home. On top of that, most of my skills are only useful if I'm in an English speaking environment.
            </p>
            <p>
            I began looking at few options that would give me additional skills and open more doors both domestically and abroad. I was prepared to go back to school if I had to, and started looking into computer science. But after some research I discovered programming bootcamps that have the abilty to transform someone with little experience, to a person with enough tools to start working as an entry level programmer. Once I made this discovery I immediately put 100% of my energy into making this a reality.
