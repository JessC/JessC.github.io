          <p>
            It took me a while but I have finally arrived at what I feel is my true calling in life. You'll notice my path to becoming a web developer doesn't include computers till later on. But the curiosity and drive to learn and build new things has always been there.
          </p>
          <p>
            I spent the first 5 or so years of my life on an island. We had no heating, air, or even running water. So unlike my 3 year old nephew who can navigate an iPad, I spent the majority of my time outside. It wasn't till 3rd grade that I had my first experience with a computer. It was in the corner of our class and if we finished our work early we could play "Oregon Trail". Man I loved that game! But I loved finding out how things worked and making new things even more. In elementary school, I would spend my allowance on old electronics at yard sales just to take them apart. 
          </p>
            <p>
            I finally took an electronics class when I was about 11. We built electric motors from scrap pieces of metal and wire. I won the award for having the most efficient motor. Around the same time I took a small engines class with all adults. I learned how to completely rebuild a lawnmower engine. I used this knowledge to fix old mowers and get money by clearing brush around the neighborhood. Naturally, when I started to drive, I was able to work on my own vehicle. I didn't particualary like getting covered in dirt and oil but I loved solving problems myself. The greatest feeling is was turning the key and having everything work and realizing I saved a lot of money.
          </p>
          <p>
            Around the end of high school and the begining of college I had to start using computers to complete school work. It wasn't until my junior year of college that I finally bought my first computer. At this point in my life, I had already decided to take career in management. I mostly used my computer to store pictures, music, and edit videos of friends. It wasn't long before my computer would need repair. I destroyed the screen after driving away with it on top of my roof. I had fixed so many other small electronics and appliances that I didn't have to think twice about just buying a new screen and doing it myself. Eventually I would take it apart again to replace the fan, then the hard drive, and so on.
          </p>
          <p>
            Anyone who's used a computer can tell you that you're much more likely to run into software related problems. Senior year in college, friends were already calling me up to do the easiest things, like replacing doorknobs and doing oil changes. Suddenly people were now asking for help with their computers. I didn't really have any experience but I never turned down a challenge. Hitting restart and having everything work gave me the same feeling as turning to key.
          </p>
          <p>
            I graduated college and pursued a career in management until the economy began to decline. I turned that into an opportunity to live and work overseas. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I desire to find out more about the software side of computers began to grow. I looked into creating an iPhone app but it required a Mac so I put that on hold. Later, I looked into moving back home to go to school and get a CS degree at Cal Poly. I was denied because I already have a bachelors degree. I would have to spend at least a year doing prerequiste courses to even think about entering a masters program. I decided going back to school was what I needed to do. But then I discovered Dev Bootcamp (DBC). Without doing any research I applied. At that point I had never even really seen a line of code. But I decided to jump in 100% and not look back. 
          </p>
          <p>
            I graduated DBC in June 2015. I was a lot of work and probably the hardest thing I've done in my life. But I'm proud to have reached a level where I have enough knowledge to start working in my new career!
          </p>

            ****DISCLAIMER - I made this website my 2nd week of DBC. The first week was mostly introduction and computer set up, so this was the first real thing I did. There's no Javascript, AJAX, or cool frameworks...it doesn't even scale. I plan to leave it that way cause I was pretty damn proud of it at the time. If I decide to blog in the future I'll make a new website and post a link on here.****

          <!-- <p>
            I graduated college and started working a corporate job. I envied friends that had the ability to travel abroad before they jumped into a career. So when the economy declined in 2008 and my company closed it's locations in California, I didn't hesitate to take a trip. After a month in Europe I started working for another big company. But I immediately felt that I wanted more international experience.
            </p>
            <p> So after working only 3 months, I packed up everything and moved to Asia. I spent the next several years working in Asia and Europe. I enjoyed a new sense of freedom that comes with working internationally. But at the same time, I felt more confined than ever before. Most of the time my work visa was usually tied to a specific company. And employers know they can pretty much do whatever they want...because the only other option is to quit and have to return home. On top of that, most of my skills are only useful if I'm in an English speaking environment.
            </p>
            <p>
            I began looking at few options that would give me additional skills and open more doors both domestically and abroad. I was prepared to go back to school if I had to, and started looking into computer science. But after some research I discovered programming bootcamps that have the abilty to transform someone with little experience, to a person with enough tools to start working as an entry level programmer. Once I made this discovery I immediately put 100% of my energy into making this a reality.
