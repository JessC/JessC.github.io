        <h2>Conflict</h2><h4>Feb 15, 2015</h4>
        <p>
       This was a long time ago, about 10 years to be exact. But reading the example conflict in the instructions brought back these wonderful memories of a similar conflict I had.<b>
       It all started on a Saturday night in college. There were four of us roommates living in a house. Two of them were out of town for the weekend. It happened to be the two that I was close to, the other one was their friend from back home. I felt like we didn't really click but we never had any problems before this night. So as I was saying, it was a Saturday night and I had just detailed the kitchen because I was hosting a study group the next day and I planned on going out and sleeping in. <br>
       Well it's about 3am when I come waltzing in and I see my roommate preparing his go to meal of ramen. I remember being quite shocked though, because it looked like the kitchen had just been used to prepare a superbowl party followed by a thanksgiving dinner. <br>
       I specifically remember asking him as nice as I could please try to clean it up by around noon. I thought that was a generous amount of time. But he wasn't having it. I explained how I had a study group coming the next day and otherwise I wouldn't have even said anything. He began telling me how I needed to move my bicycles from the living room and put them outside where they belong. I had lived there first so they were there when he moved in. I told him he could have brought that up months ago, but he was just fishing for things to say. For some reason he had a habit of coming home from basball practice while we were still in school and leaving his clothes, namley his jock strap, in the living room floor or even on the couch. I mentioned how I never brought up this up because I, along with the other two roommates compromise are standards on different things in order to all live in harmony.<br>
       Well he went back to the bike issue. He grabbed my custom made bicycle that I had paid over $5000 for and said he was going to put it out side. I got in front of him and asked him to please leave my bike alone. I'll try to find somewhere else for it if it was bothering him so much. He rammed it into me and I fell back almost crashing into my saltwater fish tank. I got up and he continued to try to push it through me. But I ripped it out of his hands and put it behind me. Then he went ape shit. He picked up the now boiling pot of water and threatend to throw it at me. I don't recall exactly what happend next, only that I grabbed him by the neck and threw him against the counter. A wine glass fell on the floor or it might have already been there. Then I picked him up and dropped him on his back breaking the wine glass. I put my knee in his chest and held my fist up. I said we could continue or we can just go to be and we'll talk about it in the morning when we weren't drunk. He chose the later and I let him up.<br>
       As soon as he got up, he grabbed some little card from his wallet and started calling up his fraternity to come over and back him up. I went to the neighbors house, because they were still up drinking. I was there for only like 10 minutes and told them what happend and that I was going back home to sleep. But if they heard me call them, they should come help. In front of my house were a bunch of guys. I said if they wanted to do something lets do it, otherwise I'm going to sleep. And I walked through them, into the house. When they realized I lived there they told my roommate he needed to solve his own issues since I lived there. He locked himself in his room for days and when the other two came back there wasnt much more talk of it. We just avoided each other. In the end there was one more incident which is actually a better story. This ended with his parents coming to pick him up. Sadly he ended up in a mental institution. <br>
       I know this was just a fun story and had no real good resolution, but I felt like telling it. And even conflicts like this, which didn't have the best out come. They help build experience in how to better handle future conflicts.
