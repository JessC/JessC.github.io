  </h2><h3>Thinking Style</h3>
  <h5>01/10/2015</h5>

  In my Pre-Phase 0 work, I learned that my Gregoric Thinking is almost entirely Concrete Random (CR). Before writing this blog entry I re-read the characteristics of a CR thinker. I couldn't agree more. I think in some aspects of my life I might fall into multiple categories. But not for coding. My thinking style is definitely an advantage but probably equally a disadvantage. I think the most advantagious would be the ability to take on other characteristics when needed. But I'll just focus on the advantages I naturally have with me thinking style in regards to my Phase 0 experience.
    </p>
    <p>
   The biggest advatage is my ability to experiment and use trial-and-error. In Phase 0 I have been doing a lot of this. And since we are working remotely, most of the work is done independently. This is great for me since I've always had problems keeping formal routines and schedules. What has pushed me compared to other people has always been competition. So I don't necissarily always compete for the end result but rather to just be better than others. This is a little different since I'm not worried at all about being the best. That would just be discouraging since there's really no reward. But I am competing to not be in last place. That's been more than enough motivation for me to get into a routine and try to keep it.
    </p>
    <p>
         My biggest struggle has also been my ability to experiment. When I think I know something and I'm on the right track I start experimenting with the code. When it doesn't work I try more stuff. 2 hours later (or longer) I'll realize that I haven't gotten anywhere. And when I try to go back I don't even know where start. What makes it worse is that it's always been extremely difficult for me to learn by reading first then applying it after. So I'm pretty worried about how things will go for the remainder. When I learn best is when I can experiment with others. And even better is when someone is immediately available to give dirrection when I get off course. This is what I'm really looking forward to after phase 0.

        I have constantly kept the idea of growth vs. fixed mindset in my mind. I'm determined to stay in the growth mindset and not drift into thinking in a fixed mindset when I get discouraged. What's great is that the more I keep myself focused on growth mindset, the more it actually supports the idea of growth....does that make sense. But no matter how much I stick to the growth mindset I have to be aware that I have certain character traits that may and may not be helpful. As mentioned earlier, I have a CR thinking style. I need to try more to adopt some of the strengths and abilities of the other mindsets to become more well-rounded.
