      <h2>Asking Good Questions</h2><h4>Feb 22, 2015</h4>
    </div>
    <p>
      During Phase 0, I asked a lot of questions. Probably 30% of my time spent typing was spent asking questions and looking for answers. The rest of the typing was for coding. I definitely learned a great deal about the importance of asking the good questions. But even good questions aren't always the 'right' questions. I would find that out through trial and error. <br>
      One thing I never did was post a question online. When a question came up, I needed the answer immediately. I couldn't afford to wait days for an answer. So all of my questions were directed at Google. <br>
      By asking questions in Google, I would often get a forum where someone posted a similar quesiton. Most of the time there was some example or problem they posted alone with it. I noticed that if they weren't specific enough, people wouldn't really understand what result they were looking for. This is especially true if there was nothing provided for a reference. For example, if I wanted to know how to get a value in a JavaScript array. I should mention whether it's in an object or not. <br>
      Even though I didn't post any questions on a forum, Google would often provide resources for the exact question I asked. So if I wasn't getting that result I wanted, I first went back and evaluated the question. There was a lot of face palm moments when I realized I should have included a key word...or my terminology was off.<br>
      So far my questions have been relatively basic and there has been no need to have someone look at my specific code. But I feel more than confident to successfully post future question to forums. Well that's not that hard. But being able to do it without being berated by a multitude of keyboard warriors can sometimes be challenging. And that, I can do.
