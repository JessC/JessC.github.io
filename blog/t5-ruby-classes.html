      <b>**I realized after doing this, it's not accurate, I need to go back and fix it so don't try to learn about classes from reading this post just yet**</b>

      Over the past week we've been introduced to Ruby classes. In my mind I immediately compared them to an array. Because, like an array, they hold information. Well, not exactly. Classes store methods to get certain information. 

      Previously we've been writing our methods like the example below...instance methods. You need to call a new instance of the method when you want to use it.

    <p>
      By putting these methods in a class, we can conitnue to insert new variables in the method. This is good for storing the same kind of information but making it unique. If we make a class of 'People' we can define a method inside called person. We might make it give us information such as name, age, and gender. And if you can imagine a literal class(room) of people. You know that everyone is unique. So by callin person in a class, we can give everyone unique information. In the image below, have now put our method in a class.
