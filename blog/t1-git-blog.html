      <h2>Version Control</h2>
      <h4>Dec 13, 2014</h4>

    <p>
     Version control is a way of organizing each saved instance of your file. It sort of like when you create a draft of an email you've been writing. You can leave and come back to it at that saved point. Even if it's on a different computer. But version control is more than that because you can always come back to that point even if you continue to make more changes and save them. You can go to each of those saved points at any time. It's great if you somethings suddenly stops working right that had previoiusly worked. 
     In short, it tracks changes to a file.
   </p>
   <p>
     What git does is keep track of these changes. You could of course do this yourself. Everytime you make a change to a file you could save it and change the name slightly by maybe adding a number. But you would have to make sure your number sequence is always correct. This would be hard if you're working on multiple things, like editing pictures from a wedding. You also have to remember where everything is being saved.

   <p>
     Using GitHub to store code can make things very efficient for a programmer. First of all, everything is stored online and can be accessed by multiple devices as long as there is an internet connection. It also can be accessed by many different people at the same time. These people can all be working on the same project simultaneously. There is no need to worry about being overwritten because the file is updated in real time. This could be disastrous if 4 people went home with a copy of a file and spent the weekend working on it. There would no doubt be 4 different versions on Monday.
