					<h2>Mac vs PC - part 1</h2><h4>Dec 2015</h4>
				</div>
				<p>
COMING SOONish
<!-- I didn't grow up in this age of modern technology. Not talking about just smartphones and apps. I wont go on too much but here are some of the things I'm talking about. I didn't have a cell phone until college. Computers were more of a luxury than a necissity. Internet was painful with dialup, blah blah blah. 

So when I think think about current technologt, specifically the software engineering I can easily draw parralells to other experiences in life. 
One of those being the automotive industry. I bought my first Mac just over a year ago. I've always been on a PC. Thats much different than mobile where I was primarily iOS then added Android   -->
