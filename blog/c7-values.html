        <h2>Values</h2><h4>Feb 8, 2015</h4>
        <p>
       In this blog I'm going to talk about values. First, I was asked to think of times in my life when I've been the happiest, proudest, and most satisfied. Then think about which values come to mind. So here is a list of some of those values.

       Adventure, Close Relationships, Competition, Condifence, Coolness Under Fire, Efficiency, Freedom, Friendships, Growth, Helping others, Inspiration, Intellectual Status, Meaningful Work, Personal Development, Physical Challenge, Quality, Recognition, Reputation, Responsibility, Self-reliance, Stabiility.

       So on a scale from 1-5 I would say I range from 4-5 for each of the values above. 

       The one value that sticks out above all others right now is confidence. Anyone who has paired with me knows that this is something I don't have with coding. 
       In my whole life there has been many things that have came extremely easy for me...mostly physical activities. For example. I was snowboarding black diamond runs my first day. 
       And then there were things that were extremely hard. An example of that would be my first algebra class in college. I attempted it 4 times before it finally clicked my junior year. 
       The thing is, when something isn't easy for me at first, I generally don't do it, I just avoid it and do something else. This is especially true if others are around because I constantly compare myself to others. 
       There are certainly times when I have been required to do something difficult and usually it turns out successfull but requires more work than I am used to doing. 
       I knew coding wasn't going to be easy. When looking at code, I get the same feeling as when I look at a big math problem. Except with math I would loose all confidence and accept failure if I couldn't do finish it in a comparable time frame as others. I like to have confidence when doing something. Even if it's new I like to able to at least have additional skills that I could teach others in order to have value and feel that confidence to keep going.  I knew coming into this I would feel discouraged and would constantly remind myself that I can do this, it's just going to take a level of commitment that I've never had to endure. It really has built my confidence that members of my accountability group have continued to ask my advice even though I feel that I am struggling a bit. 
       I know that I have created my own stereotype threat and that's something I'm hoping to overcome. Basically I have stereotyped myself as not capable of being good at anything that doesn't come easy at first. It sounds crazy but it's very real for me. And the best way to overcome it is too work hard and stay busy so that before I know it, I have enough knowledge and experience to overpower any feelings of incompetence.
