        <h2>Blog Update</h2><h4>Feb 22, 2015</h4>
        <p>
       Towards the begining of the week, before even reading this challenge. I went through and made sure all my blog links worked from any page that I was on. That is something that I had put off but it bothered me so much that I just ended up fixing it. Now after reading this challenge, I will take the opportunity to try and do a little bit more work. One thing that I have really been wanting to do was to keep the head stationary and have the page start scrolling below it..so that it looks like it's going behind the header.
        Also, I want to integrate the cheat sheet I created last week into a similar design. Lastly, I want to finish the 'About Me' and 'Contact' sections...oh, and update my profile picture<br><br>

        work...work...work...work...workin on my shhBlog....

        <br><br>
        Ok...so now about 10hrs have passed since I wrote the previous bit. One thing I had fogot to mention was that I paired in person with two people and showed them my blog in person. So some of the things I am changing comes from their feedback.<br>Oh man, I forgot how time consuming CSS positioning can be!! I spent a very long time on the smallest detail and didn't really get it to be how I envisioned. But I know where the problem is and to fix it would take much longer. Since it's perfectly fine how it is, I'll just leave it. I did integrate the cheat sheet page to look exactly how I wanted. The next step for that will be to update the cheat sheet so that there it's actually worth looking at.  <br>I also forgot how frustrating it can be to get links and pictures all set up, only to find that the links don't quite reach the proper file. After a few hours I was whizzing through it though. It got to be a easier...but then I wanted to change something which would mean goint through every single page again. <br>I heard others that came in with much more experience spent hours setting up their framework. I now wonder if I should have gone that route even if it took me twice as long. Because I'm sure I won't have the time once I'm on site.
        <br>
        So what did I do. Well, I was able to fix all the links. I added a couple more pictures that I took. But I wasn't able to update my profile picture. I realized the picture I had in mind is on a computer or hard drive back home. Also, I didn't get to the scrolling. It's actually fairly simple to leave the header stationary. But there is one little surprise that I had in mind thats going to require some additional research on my part. The next time I work on my blog I will start with that and hopefully I will be able to turn it into a page that I originally envisioned!
