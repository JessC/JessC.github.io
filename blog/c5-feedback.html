      <h2>Feedback</h2><h4>Jan 25, 2015</h4>
    </div>
    <p>
      So far in our course, we've had many opportunities to pair with others. They've all definitely been a unique experience. One emotion that arose during a pairing session was relief. It's happened many times for many reasons. Even though I've had a lot of communication with others, I still get the feeling of being on a different page than others. A big part of that feeling is because I've been trying not to compare myself to others as much. And by default, I've convinced myself that I'm constantly playing catch up. But often I've found others are going through the exact same things as myself. It's really been very valuable to know that I share the same emotions as others whether it's the excitement of completing a challenge or the frustration on just getting through a list of instructions.
      I particularly enjoyed the html/css pairings. I felt that I had a good grasp on the task and my pair and I were able to get through the challenges while also teaching each or new things. I've struggled a bit more in ruby. And my confidence was not there at first. 
      About a week and a half ago, long before reading my feedback, I decided that I need to show more confidence in when pairing. This will be beneficial to both of us. After looking through my feedback, I wasn't surprised to see that a pair had suggested having more confidence in myself. 
      I didn't really need to read the feedback to know how things went in the pairing sesssions. With most of my pairs, we've been able to talk openly about things that did and didn't work. I guess reading the feedback just reafirmed how I imagined things have been going. And really, they've been a confidence booster. I've been competitive all my life and have competed in multiple sports. I've been working on the habit of thinking "If I'm not winning, then I'm loosing". As I pair with more people, I've able to think of us as all being on the same team. And we're all driving towards the same goal of graduating! I really have seen myself growing both technically and culturally.
