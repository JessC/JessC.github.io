      I could immediately relate to the kitchen vs table idea. For me it is like renting a house with a bunch of people like we do in college. Versus moving into a spare room in someones house like I'll probably be doing for phase 1 and beyond. 
      Living with roomates where nobody owns the house and everyone pays the same forms a atmosphere of equality that can change a little if someone has lived there longer or has a bigger room. But everyone shares responsibilities. 
      Renting a room immediately makes you feel smaller. But you also feel a less resonsibility in return. If a pipe breaks then the owner fixes it. 
      The same feeling applies to working for a business or starting your own. I definitely understand what is being said in the video. Unfortunately I too often feel like I'm in a restaurant if I don't feel as though I'm an equal. I'll need to put in effort to be part of this tiny temporary community so we can learn and grow successfully.

        I would definitely place myself on the side of feeling like an imposter. I have no doubt I can learn the material but I have absolutely no background and I'm a true beginnner. Until I meet or becomoe aware of others like me, I feel like the feeling probably won't go away. I'm confident that there will be times when I understand things that others do not. I'm looking forward to this because if I can help them maybe they can help me.

        One thing that has always been difficult for me is to be social when things have not clicked. Instead I become withdrawn so that I can absorb the information. If I don't understand something that is different. I will ask. But so far I haven't really gotten stuck but I haven't felt that mental release where I can talk about things. I'm basically not sure what to say at the moment. When I start running into problems I hope to reach out to others. And if something has clicked for me I hope to help others.

        I watched the video all the way through and one thing I definitely do not expect is to land a high paying job right after. I hopefully will have enough skills to land a job in the tech field within a reasonable amount of time. Not having a huge expectation creates less stress. I'm very nervous about DBC. For some reason I feel like everyone else is already a computer programmer while I barely know how to copy and paste a file. This is true by the way. I just bought a Mac for this course 2 days ago. I'm learning the material on a foreign operating system.
