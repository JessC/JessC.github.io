      <h2>Arrays and Hashes</h2><h4>Jan 11, 2015</h4>
    </div>
    <p>

      This weeks blog compares the difference between arrays and hashes. I haven't had much practice with hashes up to this point to I'll just be giving my observations from what I read. Down the road I'll try to come back and update this. I'll start out by saying that they both ways of holding things. Let's first talk about arrays.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrays can be defined in a method and are indicated with []. Both numbers and strings can be placed inside and separated by " , ". It I were to create an array that had the letters a and be it would look like this ["a", "b"]. The information in an array is indexed with numbers...always starting with 0. So "a" = 0 index and "b" = 1 index. You can manipulate whats inside of the array by using their index numbers. So if I wanted to delete certain elements I could do it by their index number. 
      I should mention too, that an array is not set in stone on it's creation. Elements can be added and subtracted at will. There is a lot more that can be done with arrays and you can read more about what can be done here: <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.0/Array.html">Arrays</a>. But the important thing to be remembered here is that they are a collection of objects that are listed by interger indexing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hashes are similar to arrays but are not indexed with numbers. Instead they can be indexed by any object. Numbers go in order so we can easily know the indexed value of an array. But since hashes can use anything, their index or key is always listed next to it. A useful exammple would look like this {"name" => Ruby, "age" => 40} As you can see, hashes will be very beneficial for creating codes that require users to input information. I'm excited to learn more. One place I'll likely be refering to a lot is here: <a href="http://ruby-doc.org/core-2.0/Hash.html">Hashes</a>.
