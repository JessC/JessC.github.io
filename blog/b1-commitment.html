					<h2>Commitment</h2><h4>Sept 2015</h4>
				</div>
				<p>
					It just occured to me why creating software is so appealing compared to other things in life. I wouldn't really consider myself artistic. I would say that I'm creative. The problem with a lot of things that are created is that at some point you have to finish. For example, an artist finishes a painting and they're done, time to move on. And architect designs a building and when it's built, thats it. The lines can be blurred when you start upgrading, remodeling, and restoring something. When I go to car shows and see completely modified cars I have to wonder if they can still be considered a classic car.
				</p>
				<p>
					Musicians often make remixes of songs they will re-release. Maybe someone will come along later and cover their song. But again, at some point, enough is enough. There's nothing else that can or should be done.<br>
					Software is different. It contiually evolves. New features are added and taken away. There is not the same sense of commitment when writing code. You can creat something totally awesome and then keep working on it. If you think about the kinds of media we are exposed to, there's classical versions of everything...classical music, classical movies, classical literature. But there's no classical websites or programs...unless the company ceases to exist. So when I go to eBay.com, it still provides the same function it did 20 years ago. But it's continually kept current by adding content and features. Sometimes modernizing just means changing the look and layout like what Apple did with its graphics in iOS 7. But sometimes the user interface is completely overhauled like what facebook has done many times.
				</p>
				<p>
					A company like Coca Cola my try to change the original formula but it's never going to be as successful as the original. Therefore more energy is spent in advertising and packaging to keep it current. A car company must continually make minor changes to their vehicles every year. Large changes are done less often. But there must always be change and upgrades to keep their product competitive and desirable. The bigger the change, the more that things like performance,reliability, and safety come into question. So huge amounts of money must be spent on testing. <br>
					When my car manufacturer found an issue with their airbags. I recieved a letter from the dealership to go in and get a replacement. If I think about the hundreds of thousands of cars that need this work done, I could imagine it was probably quite costly. 
				</p>
				<p>
					<s>If</s> when software bugs are discovered, a team can quickly work on creating an update. Usually initial testing will catch most major problems. But even larger problems are still more manageable than hardware issues. Antennagate cost Apple and estimated $53 million. Samsung is looking at a similar issue with it's Note 5 stylus.
				</p>
				<p>
					If a feature is created/released on a webpage that turns out to be a complete disaster it can simple be removed before there is any real damage. A lot of times things must be release in order to get the level of feedback needed to see if it's successfull. Imagine George R.R. Martin using that type of feedback to go back and resurecting Jon Snow...I guess it's still possible.<br>
					This is a very intriguing part of coding for me. I always know I can go back and change something. And when I finally decide I'm finished I can move on to something else. I'll never run out of room if I want to keep creating things. This is a big reason I have no tattoos. I have a few ideas of things I would get. When it comes down to it, I know I wouldn't be able to choose the exact style, size, and location knowing that I could never change it. I'm okay with that. I have plenty of scars and I feel like they are better stories anyway.
