        <h2>Stereotype Threat</h2><h4>Jan 31, 2015</h4>
      </div>
      <p>
        I have have been aware of stereotype threat for a very long time. I actually didn't know there was a name for it until writing this blog. I grew up in a predominantly white town. My high school had a rodeo team and I took AG science instead of chemistry. I was into a lot of extreme sports and hated ball sports like basketball and football. I grew up with the same people and nobody ever thought I didn't fit in. I was pretty good at track and started going going further and further away to compete at higher levels. I noticed when going down to LA and competing with the inner city schools that people didn't really want anything to do with me. I dressed totally different, mostly in surfing brands. While most of the other people with with any shade of darker skin dressed in extremely baggy clothes and wore sports jerseys. I started realizing that people didn't really know how to interact because I didn't fit the mold. My event was pole vaulting which is also mostly white. Once while having headphones on but no music playing, I heard two guys mention me as someone they thought they didn't need to worry about because I didn't look the part. And this has always happened because of my background. Once I had just got off the mechanical bull in a "cowboy" bar in college. A guy cam up to me a bought me a drink because I won him a lot of money because his friends bet him I would immediately get thrown off. I had someone try to buy drugs from me in a bathroom once. When I told them I had never taken any drugs he angrily said "You look like you do!" and stormed off. I really could go on forever. I have always tried to be aware of the threat a stereotype can have on me or others. I lived in Korea for many years. Koreans spend a huge amount of money trying to learn to speak English. I often here all kinds of reasons on why it's especially difficult for them. I've even heard that people say that the shape of their tounges doesn't allow the appropriate movement to allow them to make the right sounds. They have really fallen into the stereotype threat where they truly believe they have a disadvantage. Like I said before, I could go on for a really really long time on this topic. And although I'm aware of it I still get caught up in stereo type threat. When I decided to code, one big thing was that people my age can't learn something new. But I thought about if one of my friends had said that to me. I would have laughed and said that's rediculous. I've always tried to push people to do things they don't think they can do. Because like Michael Jordan once said, "You miss 100% of the shots you don't take".
