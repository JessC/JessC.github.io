        <h2>The difference between Margin, Border, and Padding</h2><h4>Jan 4, 2015</h4>
<p>
Margin border and padding can be a bit confusing when first getting started in html. For me it was because they all have similar meanings. They all deal with the spacing surrounding and interior piece of code. 
My first thought was to just memorize the order. For me looking at it from inside out seemed the best. Below is a simple diagram of how its layed out. 

There’s one problem that I realized almost immediately when looking at it this way. And that is that it’s simple not enough. Even though you know the order, you really need to know how each one affects the layout of your page.
I soon found out that all, some or none of these can be used. And depending on your page padding or margin elements might look the same and be interchangeable. Or they can make it completely different. So below I will try to explain each one in simple terms.
