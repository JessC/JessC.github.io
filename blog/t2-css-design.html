        <h2>The difference between Margin, Border, and Padding</h2><h4>Jan 4, 2015</h4>
<p>

Margin border and padding can be a bit confusing when first getting started in html. For me it was because they all have similar meanings. They all deal with the spacing surrounding and interior piece of code. 
My first thought was to just memorize the order. For me looking at it from inside out seemed the best. Below is a simple diagram of how its layed out.

<p>
There’s one problem that I realized almost immediately when looking at it this way. And that is that it’s simple not enough. Even though you know the order, you really need to know how each one affects the layout of your page.
I soon found out that all, some or none of these can be used. And depending on your page padding or margin elements might look the same and be interchangeable. Or they can make it completely different. So below I will try to explain each one in simple terms.
</p>
<p>
Padding:
If all of these terms describe the area around something then padding is the most inner area. I like to think of it as the space around the text being displayed. It’s probably more accurate to call it an inside border. But unlike a border. Padding is invisible, meaning you cannot change the color or style. Color is only affected by the background of the object. Below is an example of two boxes with text in them. The one on the left has no padding while they both have a a black border of 2px.

</p>

<p>
Border:
Border is directly surrounds your padding. Border can be used to create space between objects. And if it’s invisible it can give visually the same results as padding. But the border is more often used to visually separate objects. A border can be any color. It can also vary in whatever thickness you’d like. But thats not all, borders can be rounded by adjusting the radius. They can be created to provide a shadow property to the object. They can even consist of pictures.

</p>
<p>
Margin:
Lastly we have margins. Margins are outside of the border and are used for spacing your objects. Like padding, margins are transparent. Margins are often automatically positioned by the browser.

There are two common ways to specify these elements in css.
First, you can individually write out the different sides as show on the left.
Another write them in line. Your computer will always read from the top property first and go clockwise. If all dimensions are equal then you only have to write 
it once.
