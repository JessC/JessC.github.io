        <h2>The Internet</h2><h4>Feb 15, 2015</h4>
        <p>

          What is the Internet? Have you ever wondered how the internet works. If you're reading this blog then you probably already know, or at least have a good idea. If you don't know then you probably have a lot of questions...questiions like theses
       <br>
       Where is the internet located?<br>
       Who controls the internet?<br>
       Why do I have to pay for it?<br>
       Why is it capitalized?<br>
       <br>
       Well I could make you reading a bunch of stuff to find the answers but I'm just going to go ahead and tell you because that's how nice I am. The internet isn't really located anywhere and it's located everywhere. Nobody controls it entirely. You have to pay for it because your computer can't connect to it otherwise. That's still a topic of debate.
       <br>
       So that really didn't help, right? That's why people make you finish reading. I guess I'll try to simplfy by giving the basic components and explaining what they do.
       <br>
       <h3><br><br><b><u>Computer</u></b><br></h3>
       <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JessC/JessC.github.io/master/blog/computer.png" height="300" width="300"/><br>
       This is the starting place of your journey through the internet. You're staring at a computer right now so we're good on this one.<br>
       <h3><br><br><b><u>Router</u></b><br><br></h3>
       <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JessC/JessC.github.io/master/blog/router.png" height="300" width="300"/><br>
       The router is that little or big thing that you connect your computer to. It might have one or more antennas. It probably has a bunch of flashing lights too. This little guy is the reason your information starts going in the right direction. Information that is passed through the router is assigned a number. But your router isn't the only one your information goes through. It will pass through many routers, each time collecting another number. When it gets to it's destination and your information comes back those numbers are kind of like directions telling it where to go.<br>

       <h3><br><br><b><u>Modem</u></b><br></h3>
        This is basically a translater. I'm sure you're aware that information is broken down into bits of information called packets. This is why you see the bars that start counting everytime you download something. So a modem translates those bits of information so they can properly be displayed on your computer.<br>
       
        <h3><br><br><b><u>ISP</u></b><br><br></h3>
      <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JessC/JessC.github.io/master/blog/isp.png"/><br><br>
      ISP is short for internet service provider. It's who you pay. They are connected to the backbone of the internet. All your information goes through them. So if you wanted to argue with me that nobody controls the internet. Well nobody really does, information is still out there. But how you connect to the internet my influence what information is available. Since all your information goes through your ISP they have the ability to sensor it. Just be glad you don't live in China.

       <h3><br> <b><u>Internet</u></b><br></h3>
        Now your out in the wild...in no mans land. Internet is not actually a thing. I guess it could be the wires and satelites and stuff. But it's not an actual place. Read on...
     <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JessC/JessC.github.io/master/blog/the_internet.jpg" height="300" width="450"/><br>
        <h3><b><u>Server</u></b><br></h3>
        So everytime you go and check facebook. Your information goes to what is called a server. This is a special type of computer that stores information on hard drives. Theres a lot of data out there, so there's a lot of servers. They can be the sive of a desktop tower or they can be housed in massive buildings. If your trying to get the daily picture from your cats in costumes website then your server probably is shared by many other websites. This is because people pay for someone to host it. Just like your duck face bathroom profile picture is stored on facebooks servers. And again, since it's not yours, this is another point of censorship. Servers are where you send information and where you recieve information. Think of it kind of like an external hard drive. Or not.<br>

    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/JessC/JessC.github.io/master/blog/large_server.jpg" height="300" width="300"/>
        <br><br>
        So that's the basics. If you're still haven't got your fix look at the picture below and start out with this simple <u><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7_LPdttKXPc">video</a></u>.<br><br>
