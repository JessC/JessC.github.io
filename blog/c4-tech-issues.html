      <h2>Tech Issues</h2><h4>Jan 17, 2015</h4>
    </div>
    <p>
      The tech industry doesn't seem to be slowing down anytime soon. There is such a demand for software engineers that it's becoming an increasingly desirable field. Computer Science graduates are on the upper end of as far as starting salaries go. But they also often find themselves with a long period of unemployment before they land there first job. This is because tech companies want people with experience.
      With the demand so great, why wouldn't they hire them at a lower starting salary and have them learn on the job. This makes sense in other fields and companies sometimes prefer to do this so they can mold you into the employee they want you to become. But this field is different because graduates often find themselves competing against people who were self taught. They have the knowledge and experience required. They may also feel less entitled to a high salary as well as not having an expensive loan that would require a higher salary.
      This means that graduates may have to spend additional time and money sharpening their skills in order to land their first job. I had actually looked at going back to school to get a CS degree. I would have to complete a list of pre-requisites just to get in. Then after graduating, years would have past and I might not have the experience unless I were to do additional work while in school. Bootcamps of varying degrees of difficulty seem like an great new solution since they are relatively short and can give beginners and graduates alike the experience they need to land their first job.
