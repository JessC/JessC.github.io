                                        <li><b>Check Engine light</b> - The check engine light will flash for a few seconds after turning on the truck when you're within 500 miles of needing an oil change. After 500 miles it will remain illuminated. Check the sticker in the corner of your windshield. If your odometer hasn't reached that number and light is on then something else is going on. Most likely something small like a loose gas cap. If the Check Engine light is flashing that indicates there's a more serious problem and definitely shouldn't be ignored. Get the truck to a mechanic as soon as possible. </li>

                                        <li><b>ECT (Electronically Controlled Transmission)</b> - This button is similar to a Sport Mode you would find in a performance car. It causes the transmission to downshift more quickly and often and will also hold the gear longer before upshifting. This is especially helpful when getting on freeways with short onramps. Read about <a href="https://www.downeasttoyota.com/blog/what-does-the-toyota-tacoma-ect-button-do/" target="_blank">ECT button</a> </li>
                                        <br>
                                        <li><b>Traction Control</b> - even these base model Tacomas can be reasonably capable vehicles if you know how to use them. There's a lot of manipulation happening to the wheels automatically which is good normal driving conditions. This can be undesirable and even unsafe in off road conditions. When you're driving off road the truck will limit throttle response when it senses a reduction in traction. Sometimes the ground is so loose that the wheels are need to slip a little. But if the truck is trying to prevent this then you may end up stuck because the truck will refuse to go. (I have been parked in mud on flat ground and with the pedal to the floor and the truck refused to give power to the wheels) Putting the truck in 4WD turns off most of these features and will avoid digging ruts and destroying land, use it. In rare cases you might want to turn off the features in 2WD if a sudden loss of power could be dangerous. One example would be pulling out onto a highway from a muddy access road. You can turn off the features in 2WD by holding in the TRAC button (pic below) for 3 seconds while you are at a COMPLETE stop. Pushing the button for less than 3 seconds or while moving will result in some half ass'd setting which will turn on Auto LSD and the truck will try to apply the brakes to the wheels that are slipping the most. See next section.</li>

                                        <li><b>LSD (auto limited slip differentials)</b> - The main problem with a standard differential is that it sends power to the wheel with the least amount of traction. Our trucks are equiped with a FAKE limited slip differential system. Basically the truck will apply the brake to only the wheel thats slipping in hopes that more power is transferred to the other wheel. In my experience this feature sucks. Just put the truck in 4 wheel drive and move on with your day. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nC6fsNXdcMQDifferentials" target="_blank">Differentials</a> </li>

                                        <li><b>4WD</b> - You can activate it while driving. This is helpful if the road suddenly turns to dirt or you're crossing a creek. You can shift into H4 at speeds up to around 60mph. It will let you know if you're going to fast for it to be activated. So if your driving and traction becomes questionable because of rain, ice, mud, etc then just turn the knob to 4H. It's not great for the drivetrain to be in 4WD when the truck is on pavement or when the wheels have sufficient traction.

                                        <br>
                                        <li><b>4LO</b> - You have to be in Neutral (not Park) and be at a complete stop. Use this when climbing steep dirt access roads or anywhere else you need traction. It's also good for more safely decending sections of dirt road. Put the truck in manual shift mode and drive down in 1st or 2nd gear so you don't have to ride the brake. </li>

                                        <li><b>cabin air filter</b> - This is the filter that cleans the air entering the truck. We drive in situations that might cause the filter two get dirty much sooner than our normal service intervals (oil changes). If you feel like your filter might not be working you can take it out and tap it on the ground or against a tree to shake the dust out to get more life out of it. It's located behind the glove box. You can access it by opening the glove box and popping out the little access door. The filter just slides out.</li>

                                        <li><b>cataliytic converter</b> - These reduce the amount of toxic emmisions that exit you're vehicle through the exhaust pipe. How do they work? Not important, just know they need to get really hot to do their job. They can get as hot as an open flame. And guess where they're located. They're under the truck between the engine and the muffler. If you're working in hot and dry conditions you might want to give the underside of you're truck a quick glance when you park if you think theres a chance you may have picked a dead branch or debris. Shit, I'll sometimes give it a little squirt with the water backpack just to drop the temp down a few hundred degrees if I think a tumble weed or some trash might find it's way under there while I'm away.

                                        <li><b>tires</b> - Do yourself and anyone else that might drive your truck a giant favor and get proper tires! The standard tires that come on the truck are great for driving around town in ideal weather conditions. Once you leave the asphalt they turn to garbage. You wouldn't think of doing your toughest hikes in some running shoes just like you wouldn't try running a marathon in your workboots. Don't go to Jiffy Lube for tires either. They'll try installing the jankiest shit they have in stock. I've even seen them missmatch tires which can put excess wear and tear on the drivetrain. Go to an actual tire store and if there's any push back call a supervisor. Honestly it's a safety risk.

                                        <li><b>non utility tree issues</b> - When you're staring at trees all day you might be the first one to identify a problem with it. If a tree is not putting electrical utilities in danger but is still hazardous. You can do two things, ignore it as it's not in you're job description or report it. Many cities have dedicated numbers or even websites where you can identify hazards such as fallen trees or roadkill.</li>
                                        <li><b>non tree utility issues</b> - If you find a dangerous situation involving the electrical utilites not involving vegetation then that would be considered an abnormal field condition. This goes for limbs that have fallen on lines and are completely detatched from the tree. In this situation call PGE at +1 800 PGE 5000 or the internal reporting number (866) 411-4743 (LP is zone 4)

                                        <li><b>traffic cones</b> - they can be used as a megaphone when you want a louder voice to announce you're presence without sounding like you're screaming. Or if you want to scream it can make you louder.</li>
                                        <br>
                                        <li><b>parking</b> - When parking facing out, I also try to angle the truck so the logo on the door can be seen from the front window or door. Most people know who we are and they've likely already seen our trucks in the area. If they can see who you are right away it helps get their guard down before you tell them you have to murder their tree.</li>
                                        <br>
                                        <li><b>three point turns</b> - We often need to turn around on roads that are not wide enough for a u-turn. The safest way is to pull off road entirely into a turnout or driveway and re-enter in the direction you want to go. This is not always possible or practicle. When that's the case I look for a driveway on the same side of the road I'm traveling. I pull just past the drivway and then back in so that when I pull out I'm facing forward.

                                            <u>Dog Treats</u> - If you don't already, it's not a bad idea to carry a bag of treats in your truck. I also have a can of dog spray but I've never used it.
                                            <br>
                                            <br><u>The Silent Type</u> - When entering an enclosed area such as a backyard it's always wise to check for dogs. Most people don't have signs notifying the presence of a dog, especially if it's a backyard. Usually dogs will let you know they're there but sometimes it might be too late. When I enter a backyard I look for signs that a dog could be present such as toys or land mines. Once I didn't see either, but as I opened a gate I could smell a dog and I quickly turned to go back. Just as I turned to close the gate a German Shepard came racing around the corner of the house towards me. 
                                            <br>
                                            Another time I was standing on a sidewalk next to a white picket fence. Out of the corner of my eye I saw something jump up towards my arm from inside the fence. I instictively moved my arm as I turned and saw a dog jumping up at me with its mouth wide open ready to take a bite. Neither dog made no sound.<br>
                                            <br>
                                            <u>Escape Artists</u> - When you see an agressive dog that's chained up or fenced in. Take a quick look to make sure it's going to hold the dog. I was looking at some lines behind a church one day and there was a dog behind a wooden fence that was really angry I was there and was pushing against the wooden fence boards. It ended up breaking one of the boards and ran towards me. Unfortunately it was between me and my truck and when I tried to back away it got more agressive so I held my ground. I'm not very afraid of dogs so we had a standoff for a bit and I was finally able to get to my truck.

                                        <li><b>snake bites</b> - Encounters with snakes are rare and bites are almost unheard of. But I've almost stepped on three snakes in one day so they're out there. Snake chaps or snake gaiters are effective in stopping snake bites. They're similar to soccer shin guards and provide 360° covereage to the lower leg. (most bites happen below the knee)

                                        <li><b>ticks</b> - Ticks suck, literally. To me they're the worst part of the job. But if you don't find them crawling on you every now and then you're probably not doing a very good job. DRG provides repellent. Talk to your supervisor. I also bought my own and will apply three different types at once depending on how thick the vegetation I'm walking through is.
                                            <br>

                                        <br>
                                        If or when you do get a tick, your first aid kit should have tweezers. But be smart enough to get it out without squeezing the body. I've found tick keys are a great alternative. Slow and steady is the way to go though. If you try to pop it out like you're opening an IPA with a lighter then the heads going to break off inside of you and that's gross.

                                        <li><b>Always go through with the refusal procedure if there's any possible threat to your safety or the tree crews!</b></li>

                                    <li>I found that going down the list and calling people blindly isn't always the best. It's courteous but it slows things down and allows people to object to the inspection. I try to only call people with locked gates or people that want to be notified before accessing their property. It can waste a lot of time setting up an appointment just to walk behind someones house and see everythings clear.</li>
                                    <br>
                                    <li>If you can't find someones information through PG&E then try to get creative. It's rare that you have to get too gangster but if you need to here's three things you can try.
                                    <div style="padding-left: 5rem; text-align: left;";><ul class="list-inline">
                                        <li><b>1:</b> There are lots of free people search websites. You can search using name, address, or phone number. </li>
                                        <li><b>2:</b> You can ask neighbors if they have contact information.</li>
                                       <li> <b>3:</b> If you have a name you can check social media and find family members or their employment. </li>

                                   </div>
                                    <li>If a property says to notify first and there's no access issues I like to go straight to the front door. The first thing I say is something like "Hey my notes say you'd like to be notified first, I'm with Davey Resource Group blah blah blah". Then I ask if now is a good time to do the inspection. They almost always are cool with just having you do it right then.</li>
                                        <br>
                                    <li>Try refraining from giving people the option to be a refusal. I don't resort to turning someone into a refusal until I've tried resolving it myself. Explain why the work needs to be completed. Refer to <a href="https://selectree.calpoly.edu/right-tree-right-place/utility-precautions/trees-and-utilities" target="_blank">General Order 95., Rule 35</a>. When you talk about trimming be sure to mention sag, sway, maximum growth potential, and any other factors used to determine clearances. In a nice way I also let people know that becoming a refusal will not stop the inevitable. </li>
                                    <br>
                                    <li>If someone is a past refusal or is known for being sensitive I try to connect with them first. Talk about their dog, truck, or whatever else you can hold an intelligent conversation on. Sometimes the conversations can get weird, it's your choice if you want to go there. I have no shame, I'll nod my head in agreement with with extreme political and religious views if it allows me to get the job done.</li>
                                    <br>
                                    <li>Try to find out what the problem is. Not all sensitive customers care about their trees. If it's too many visits then suggest bigger clearances, TGR, or removals.</li>
                                    <br>
                                    <li>If I see that someones over concerned or refused in the past I might ask a neighbor if I can look at trees from their yard especially if I see them outside. I try to be extra polite to the neighbor and definitely give them the option to refuse since they have no trees. If they say no I appologize for disturbing them and leave. People almost always say yes and usually offer tree crews access if needed. I think this is helpful in two ways. First, you're able to talk to the person neighbor and inform them of what we do. A lot of people see our trucks driving around but aren't exactly sure what we're up to. Second, if nothing needs to be trimmed then you're giving that sensitive customer an extra year before they'll have to deal with a routine inspector again. I don't do it very often but I'll definitely do it if I'm having difficulty gaining access.</li>
