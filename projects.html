   	<p>Is an example of the types of assignments I completed at Dev Bootcamp. The purpose of this particular challenge was to learn how jQuery and Javascript can be used in HTML.
   	I re-did this assignment and challenged myself to do more than was required. I did so by writing JavaScipt algorithms and using some animation.</ul>
   	<li>To try it out:</li>
   	<li>1. Click on Orange to go directly to repo</li>
   	<li>2. Clone it to your computer</li>
   	<li>3. Navigate to HTML file and open it with your browser</li>

   	<h1>Instograph</h1>
   	<p>
   	I'm in the process of creating this app in my free time. Users can upload pictures and have them displayed with a caption.
   	They can also go to the map page where they will be prompted with OAuth to login into instagram. They will then be able to see a map with with pictures from their friends placed on it depending where they were taken.
