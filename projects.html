     <ul><h2>Hitch</h2>

     Drivers post trips that they are plannign to take and how many seats are available. 
     Passengers can view a list of upcoming trips or use a search function to find one. They can drag and drop their profile picture into a picture of a car to automatically be added to the trip.
     Drivers and passengers can communicate through an in app messaging system.
     At the end of the trip, a "star rating" voting system becomes availble to leave feedback on other members.</ul>

   	<h2>Orange Trees</h2>
   	Is an example of the types of assignments I completed at Dev Bootcamp. The purpose of this particular challenge was to learn how jQuery and Javascript can be used in HTML.
   	I re-did this assignment and challenged myself to do more than was required. I did so by writing JavaScipt algorithms and using some animation.
   </p>
  
   <p>
   	<h2>Instograph</h2>
   	I'm in the process of creating this app in my free time. Users can upload pictures and have them displayed with a caption.
   	They can also go to the map page where they will be prompted with OAuth to login into instagram. They will then be able to see a map with with pictures from their friends placed on it depending where they were taken.
