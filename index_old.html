    <h3><b>Welcome to my blog</b></h3>
    <p>
      I started this blog mid december 2014. It mostly consists of blog entries I wrote during Phase 0 of Dev Bootcamp. Those blog entries, which were usually written in under an hour, document my progression and understanding of new things presented to us. 
      Go to the <a href="About.html">About Me</a> section to read a brief summary of my life and how it led me to becoming a developer.
