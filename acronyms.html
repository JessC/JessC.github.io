I would rather fight a single horse-sized duck. For one, he is only a duck, and the only weapon is his bill. I have never seen an angry duck, but I have seen an angry horse. Horse hooves can kill you. I imagine a giant duckbill could kill you too. But with a duck, all I would need to do is shove some food in his bill to calm him down. I have tried to feed a hundred ducks before, and it's tiring, but they would never hurt you. One hundred angry horses trying to strike you with their hooves reminds me of a scene in Jurassic Park. No thanks.
