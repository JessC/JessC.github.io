		This site is was not only created to show some of my projects but to also be used as an example. It's purely front and was created using HTML, CSS, Javascript, and Jquery. Because I wanted to use it as an example, I chose not to use a framework and to make limited use of bootstrap. It doesn't make a whole lot of sense to try to invent code for front end features since practically everything has been done before and can easily be found on the internet. So, for example, when I wanted to randomize the colors when a user hovers over a project I simply looked up javascript code to find a random hex value. Then modify the code to fit my application.

		My first personal site was multiple pages and I decided to switch to a single page on this site with distinct sections the user can scroll to. I also liked a nav bar to make it possible to go directly to a specific section. Although it's not long enough to really need this feature, I like ho the navbar makes the name of each available section visible in one place. The navbar is also a convenient spot to place links to relevant external sites. To give it the cleanest look possible, the navbar will only appear after the user starts scrolling down and will disappear after scrolling back to the top.

		Eventually I want to replace the main picture with a cinemagraph of the same location where only the waterfall moves. The other instances will remain black and white to not take away from the main focus of the section.

		The "About" section highlights my main skills as a developer while the background photo shows a more relaxed side of myself. Hovering over "more" will reveal slightly more information about myself

		My recent projects are listed using screenshots of a page. When you hover over one of the pictures you will get the name of the project along with some of the technologies used. Each time you hover over a project the background color will be different.
		Clicking on a project will cause the thumbnails to disappear and replaced with a window showing a bigger picture and more information about that specific project. There is also a link to the site if it's deployed or the github page containing the code if not.

		The idea of the "Gum Wall" is to just be a random place where anything can be included. It was originally going to be a blog until I realized I'm not much of a blogger. I replaced it with a picture of a gum wall from my hometown and pieces of gum. Every time the page is refreshed the gum appears in the same order but a slightly different place.

		I wanted to make a "contact" section where people could reach out to me without havint to go to a different site or even open there own email. It was a bit tricky to figure out though because this usually requires a back end. Fortunately I found a service to act as a back end. It really doesn't require anything more than forwarding information from a form I create. In order to minimize recieving random junk, I added validations to the contact form.
