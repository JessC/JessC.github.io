		<h3 id="question">Did I see somewhere that you attended a bootcamp?</h3>
<div id="answer"; style="color: grey"><p>I graduated from <a href="http://devbootcamp.com/" target="_blank">Dev Bootcamp</a> June 2015 with honors......just kidding, there's no honors. I don't emphasize it in my experiences because it tends be looked at as the extenet of my software education. I learned a huge amount in the program, much more than I could have by myself. It was a springboard to get me where I am now by teaching me relevant technologies and best practices in a real word collaborative working environment. But, the onsite portion of the program was 19 weeks which is only a fraction of the time I have spent learning and creating software. </p></div>

<h3 id="question">I noticed a gap in your employment....</h3>
<div id="answer"><p>Yes, I was fortunate enough to have enough savings to afford not to work and commit to self study full time. I did this by relocating to the Bay Area where I lived in both San Francisco and Silicon Valley.</p>
<p>I spent that time attending confrences, seminars, and hackathons. I also completed a software bootcamp and created a number of apps from the ground up</p>
<p>I like to think of it as an alternative to going back to school. And I've never been asked why I didn't work while I was in college</p></div> 

<h3 id="question">I see that you're in the Bay Area. Are you aware that this job is not.....</h3>
<div id="answer"><p>I sure am...Although I'm from California, I have no ties to the Bay Area. I'm only here because it's the center of all things tech and the ideal place to learn from leaders in the industry. I would happily relocate for the right position.</p> </div> 

<h3 id="question">So how many years have you worked as a developer?</h3>
<div id="answer"><p>I first played around with HTML and CSS over 10 years ago. But I started actually coding in September 2014 with Ruby. However, I don't believe I can accurately measure my experience in years. Since learning to code, I have spent 1000's of hours on one thing...software development. </p>
<p>I went to college for 4 years and didn't spend nearly that amount of time on my major. Because I have commited to software development full time, I believe I have much more hands on knowledge than I would have gotten if I had went back to obtain a CS degree.</p> </div> 

<h3 id="question">and these projects/apps you've worked on. You weren't getting paid?</h3>
<div id="answer"><p>Mostly no. My earliest projects were challenges or assignments. Then there were some solo projects I created for fun and continued learning. Some projects were from hackathons which were done as a group. I most recently created an ecommerce site and am working on designing my next.</p></div> 

<h3 id="question">We/the client are using this technology, but I don't see it listed in your skills?</h3>
<div id="answer"><p>Don't worry, I'll learn it.</p></div> 

<h3 id="question">Looks like you've worked in a few other countries, whats your legal status in the US?</h3>
<div id="answer"><p>I'm a proud US citizen. My experience working with people in other cultures has been huge in understanding differences and being able to effectively collaborate with just about anyone...FYI I am also legally able to work in the EU. </p></div>
